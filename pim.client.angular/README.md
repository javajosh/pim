# Client

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.12.

## General tips

 1. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
 2. Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. 
You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
 3. Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
 4. Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). (what about Jest?)
 5. Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
 6. use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.


## More tips
 1. Run the local version of angular with `npm run ng`
