<h1>Simpatico</h1>
<p>Your computer is a bucket, gathering measurements about the world, and in return it shows you wonders. It is a
window into the world beyond anything anyone dreampt possible. The foundation of it is all is, yes, the transistor
and the integrated circuit, and recent inventions around display, battery, and even radio technology has made
always on, internet connected devices the norm. And every program you run on these devices is a bucket.</p>

<p>The browser is a bucket, too. Actually, the technical definition of a bucket is a browser tab on a concrete device.
We can introduce simple notation to acquire a new device, install a new browser, and create a new tab, for any URL.</p>

<p>The functionality we expect is the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The Server - a nodejs process</li>
  <ol>
    <li>$ git clone github/simpatico/simpatico</li>
    <li>$ cd simpatico</li>
    <li>$ cd pim.server.node</li><!-- Lots of other options here, too. -->
    <li>$ npm run start</li> <!-- Consider npx simpatico -->
  </ol>

  <li>The Client - a Modern Browser Tab</li>
  <ol>
    <li>subl index.html</li>
    <li>open http://host:port/index.html</li>
    <li>f11 or cmd+shift+i to open dev tools</li>
    <li>f5 or cmd+r to refresh</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p>Once loaded, the fun begins! The independant data are key presses and mouse movements and clicks. The server
often tries to make it easy to convert those events into a relatively meaty, structured request. Something like filling
out a form. However, the pattern is more general than that, in that you can see these events as advancing some application state.
One degenerate case is when you just squirrel away all events, and do nothing else with them.</p>

<p>So there is this image of a program as a screen region into which events (another, slightly worse, name for measurements)</p>

<p>Simpatico is a set of ideas, and this is a technical introduction to them. It is also a piece of concrete software that I invite you to use!
Simpatico is currently simply a service you might use to create ad hoc connections between your own devices, hosted within the
browser tabs of each of your devices. In this way, you can describe an important part of your "personal graph" that
reaches out into the world, and this layer is the one that directly connects to the internet: your phone, your laptop.
</p>

<p>Each device will run Simpatico for the first time with a link. The exception is the special first device, or root device,
which is the first device to connect to a new nexus. This is a special device in that it has final say in the distribution
of messages on that nexus. However, it is not stateful and only does limited computation on its inputs. A root nexus is always
named, the first of this is rooted at simpatico.io. A nexus is a very small, inexpensive process that only
  serves ordinary http resources, and then as a websocket server connects clients to each other. Each client generates a
  public private keypair. The private key is stored, encrypted, in your localstorage. Your public key is passed
  as the first argument after websocket connect, telling the nexus your device key. Next, you generate an invite from device 1
  and get it to device 2, and open it in your default browser. You now have a running node on the Simpatico network,
  and realtime communication between two of your own devices, using end-to-end RSA encryption.
</p>

<p>This doesn't go far enough! We still have not put enough useful constraints on this software. What we really want to
use it for is to build software, in the browser, from the highest quality components avialable in the world. But what kind
of software is it we want to build? Productivity software, but also software to help me measure myself, starting with my
devices and my data. But extending to my things and accounts, and even personal relationships. You will find a neat
representation of all of this within the personal graph, and Simpatico is designed to express this data structure
cleanly, and in a highly distributable way.</p>

<p>Ultimately, my goal is to empower the individual against the overwhelming power of the institution. For my entire
life I've wanted to make a substantial impact on this state of things, always being in favor of the underdog,
never wanting the easy path of "win more". But more and more I think we should use our remarkable tools for our own
benefit and stop letting ourselves be overwhelmed by software that is free, but far too expensive.</p>

<p>It is time to ask our security services to make a sacrifice. It is time to create an internet of people for the people, where
censorship becomes very difficult. Where the infrastructure is designed to be inexpensive, stateless, easy to run on anything.
I believe this set of freedoms is effectively part of the 2nd amendment: the right to bear arms, and the right
to assemble, as a bulwark against tyranny must include the right to private communication, and private
  communication patterns.</p>

<p>The argument against both freedoms is always going to be the same, and it's an honest one: it blinds us, the security forces say.
If they are just and good, perhaps this concerns you. But if they are wicked and corrupt, perhaps this is a great boon.
It is easy to imagine that your attitude depends entirely on your relationship with the nation in which you currently
exist, which of these positions you might take. But recognize that there is no meaningful way to both maintain only the right
of the just to organize against oppression of the corrupt, but also maintain the right of the unjust to organize against
  the weakness of the just.</p>

<p>So, yes, to be a nation we must trust our neighbors with guns, and with secret, secure comms with each other. We should
hope to keep the lines of communication open between any factional conflict, and that reasonable diplomacy has a chance to work.
When these things break down, violence is in the air. In most such cases, it's pretty clear who's wrong. In this case,
it's clearly the Trumpians. They would destroy our democracy to appease the ego worshiping, cruel, dishonest bastard named
Donald J Trump. Why? What do they gain by abandoning sense? What do they gain by sacrificing themselves for an odious man who
repays them with derision and disgust? What can you make of your dignity, Ted Cruz? It's easy to slip into a casual partisan whine here,
but I'm honestly asking these questions. My best answer is that it's a simple will-to-power problem, and nothing will
cure it except win-or-loose violence. My worry is that my liberal brothers and sisters don't have the stomach for blood.
In which case, they deserve to lose.</p>
